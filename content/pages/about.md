Hello world! This is my first blog website I created when I was bored.

Anyway, let's keep this quick and simple, my name is ___Uppada Vishnu___, as you can probably tell by the name of the website, and I'm a developer.

I got my University degree in **Computer Science** from ___IIT Kharagpur___ in 2021.

I am currently working at [JP Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/global) as a Software Engineer.

I do mostly interested in backend development and love working with low level programming languages 😄😄

This blog is about me and what I'm working on, and what I feel like talking about.
